          How to configure a firewall?
       </h2>
       <br>
         A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules. Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet.
         <br>
         <br>
         Acessing windows difender firewall:
         <br>
         <br>
       Open the Control Panel.
         <br>
Navigate to "System and Security" and then "Windows Defender Firewall."
         <br>
Adjusting Firewall Settings:
         <br>
Click on "Advanced settings" to open the advanced configuration window.
         <br>
Inbound Rules:
         <br>
Under "Inbound Rules," you can manage rules for incoming traffic.
         <br>
Right-click to create a new rule or modify existing rules.
         <br>
Specify the program, port, or protocol that the rule should apply to.
         <br>
Outbound Rules:
         <br>
Under "Outbound Rules," you can manage rules for outgoing traffic.
         <br>
Similar to inbound rules, create or modify rules based on your requirements.
         <br>
Rule Properties:
         <br>
When creating a rule, you'll need to specify whether it should allow or block the traffic, and you can customize the rule based on your needs.
         <br>
Programs and Ports:
         <br>
Rules can be based on specific programs, ports, or protocols. Ensure that you understand the requirements of the applications or services you're configuring.
         <br>
Monitoring and Notifications:
         <br>
Windows Defender Firewall provides options for monitoring and notifications. Adjust these settings according to your preferences.
         <br>
Apply Changes:
         <br>
After configuring the rules, make sure to apply the changes.
